<p>First of all you have to click on the "Klasse"-Button and after that click into the <a href="Jumli-View.html">UML-View</a>. Otherwise we're not able to proceed. So check your skills and just do it!<br>
Ok, on your screen the "Eigenschaften"-dialog appears. This is the window where you can set all preferences for your first class.</p>

 <td valign= top>To identificate our first class, we have to name her. There would be no sense in giving all classes the same name. The JAVA-compiler would have an overflow on senseless errors. Well, our first class will be a girl (I decided that, shut up!). So, we call it "Maedchen"<br>
Fill in the field "Name" the String "Maedchen" and look, we have done the name. A little hint: always choose names that have sense, that makes it easier to work later. If your classes and methods have names like HKlSetKarlMF8 it's hard to orientate in the resulting JAVA-sourcecode. Take names like "vehicle" or "cocktail" or something like that. That's easier. <br><br>

 <td valign= top>There are many special features classes can have. Some are including a part called main, others are "abstract" or "final". Some are asserting that they are "interfaces". But at this point that's not the problem. In the progression of this tutorial you are going to learn more 'bout these things.<br>
Back to the girls. We have to declare the group of girls for abstract. Dont't ask me why, but that's the facs. To declare them abstract click "abstract" in the dialog. "Abstract" means, that there will be no further instances of this class and the methods have to be overwritten in all cases. You don't understand this? No problem. You'll learn more 'bout that later. <br><br>

 <td valign= top>As seen in other programming-languages, JAVA has got the opporunity to set modifiers. You just have to click in the related field. We shold do that, we don't have to do that. Principally we should declare all modifiers as tight as possible. Not every class od method should be declared as public. <br>
In the case of our girls, you should declare them "public". Click in the "public"-field. Ready? OK, let's go to the next step.<br><br>

 <td valign= top>Hey wait a minute, we forgot the attributes! Well done, the cadidate get 100 point. But this was my full intention. We don't need any attributes in an abstract class.<br>
 Methods are the problem now. Methods are the possibilities of an object to be activ. A phone for example is able to ring, a car is able to hunk, to drive and many more. These capibilities we call methods. <br>
 What are the capibilities of girls? Well I think the same as those of men. But girls can talk, we all know that, better than men (and in especially more). This "talking"-Method we can build by clicking the "Neu"-button. The "Neu"-dialog appears. <br><br>
